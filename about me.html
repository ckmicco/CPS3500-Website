    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div id="page-container">
      <div id="content-wrap" style="background-color:#F4F2E5;">
        <p>My name is Christian Micco. I am a student at Kean University pursuing a Computer Science, Data Science degree. 
          I was born and raised in Rutherford New Jersey in Bergen County, which is in North Jersey. 
          I am a brother to 4 other siblings brought up in an Italian-American household, to which I claim for my confidence, faith, and passion. 
          My hobbies include playing basketball and watching the NBA, NFL, and soccer as a fan of the Brooklyn Nets, NY Giants, and Juventus teams. 
          Ever since I was a child I knew I wanted to be in the programming/tech field. 
          In middle school I thought that I would want to be a video game designer but as I matured I found myself wanting to have a greater role and contribution towards society. 
          That had led me to the interest in the software engineering field, with a keen interest in the growing field of artificial intelligence, more specifically machine learning. 
          I had spoke with a family friend and mentor to discuss a career given my interest, and he had introduced me to data science, to which I had fallen in love with.</p><br>

        <p>My professional interests are in the areas of machine learning, deep learning, and data science, while still exploring my interest in areas of application (entertainment industry, science, engineering, etc.). 
          My skills include software programming in languages such as Java, Python, and R. I have interpersonal and communication skills gained from years of work experience and my upbringing. 
          My technical and critical thinking skills have been grown and honed with a long interest and practice in the computer science field ever since a young age.</p>
